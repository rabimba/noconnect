## Features
- __off the grid:__ NC doesn't need any internet or mobile network to communicate. Each mobile device with the app installed acts as a node and connects with each other using wifi and bluetooth p2p network
- __temp users:__ All the users and usernames are disposable. Since it's not stored in any server or network. It's bound only to the device
- __encrypted:__ data streams between devices are encrypted
- __p2p network support:__ if you are part of a p2p swarm. You can communicate with everyone in that swarm



## Philosophy
The idea initially stemmed from 


## Installation
### pre-built binaries
The release section will hold some periodically built self signed apk files. You are welcome to try them out if you don't want to build the project for yourself. 
There is a time-limit for each apk, for how long it will function. Typically 3 months. This is imposed so that a user does not use a stale version (since the off the grid nature prevents us to have any kind of update mechanism)

You can remove the time limit by building the project yourself.



## Build

### Pre-Requisites
You will need Android Studio to build the project.  Clone the repository and open it in Android studio. You will need to build the project for the first time and let it download all the required dependencies and then it should build the apk for you.
